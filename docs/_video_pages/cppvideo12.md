In this video we will go over C++ pointers, what they are and how we can use them.

First, remember that every variable or object will have a memory address associated with it. When we learned about arrays back in video 8, we briefly illustrated this concept.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<br/><br/>
In the above image we can see we have two variables, 'i' an integer and 'd' a double. They both have a memory address associated with them that points to the first byte of data they occupy. Variable 'i' uses 4 bytes of data and variable 'd' uses 8 bytes since it is of type double.

We have up until now mainly accessed a variable by it's name. Using the above example we would access the value located at memory location 0x1100 by referencing the name we gave the variable, in this case 'i'. We can use the ampersand symbol to return variable 'i's address instead of it's value.

`std::cout << &i << std::endl;`  would output 0x1100 using the example above.
<br/><br/>

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object. Pointers are used extensively in both C and C++ for three main purposes:

- to allocate new objects on the heap  
- to pass functions to other functions  
- to iterate over elements in arrays or other data structures  

Like a variable, a pointer must be declared with the datatype of the variable or object it will point to, this is known as its base-type.
<br/><br/>

A pointer is denoted by using the * symbol as shown below.

```cpp
char* ch_ptr;     // pointer to a character
int  *  i_ptr;    // pointer to an integer
double *d_ptr;    // pointer to a double
```
Note that the position of the asterisk can vary, as long as it is between the datatype and variable name it's a valid form of declaring a pointer.

It is somewhat of a convention to place the * right after the datatype such as `int* ptr;` when declaring a pointer to be able to more easily differentiate it from its usage as a dereference operator `*ptr` when we want to obtain "the value of" a pointers address reference.
<br/><br/>

Symbols used with pointers:

<br/><br/>
<p align="center">

</p>

<br/>
Ampersand "&" symbol - Address Operator - Used to obtain the memory address of a variable or object. You can think of it as "the address of" operator.
Asterisk "\*" symbol - Besides being used as an operator in multiplication, when used with pointers it is used to create a pointer variable and as a dereference operator.
<br/><br/>

The avoid confusion, keep in mind the * serves two different purposes when used with pointers.

- When used in a declaration `double* ptr`, it creates a pointer variable that holds an address.
- When not being used in a declaration, it acts as a dereference operator to return the value at an address.  


```cpp
int num = 547;
int* p = & num;
std::cout << "The address of num is: " << p << std::endl;
std::cout << "The address of num is: " << &num << std::endl;
```
Output: <br/>
The address of num is: 0x6dfee8 <br/>
The address of num is: 0x6dfee8 <br/><br/>
Notice they both return the same address location.<br/>
(Note: the actual address returned will be different on your computer depending on the memory location set aside to hold the variable num.)
<br/><br/>

The Ampersand & symbol also has two meanings depending on where it is used:

- When used in a declaration `int& ref`, it creates a reference to a variable.
- When used outside of a declaration it means "the address of" the variable or object.

```cpp
int num = 547;
int& ref = num;
std::cout << "The address of num is: " << &num << std::endl;
std::cout << "The address of ref is: " << &ref << std::endl;
```
Output: <br/>
The address of num is: 0x6dfee8 <br/>
The address of ref is: 0x6dfee8 <br/><br/>
Notice they both return the same address location. By making a reference, we are simply making an alias of the variable we are referencing, in this case the variable num. We can now also refer to it using the name ref. Unlike pointers than can change, once a reference is declared it is static.


Also note that using a pointer with a char datatype requires the casting of the char pointer to type void pointer (void*) if we want to print its address due to operator overloading of the cout <<.

We will cover operator overloading in a later lesson, but for now the following example code shows how you can print out an char pointer address.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
    char ch = 'h';
    char* ch_ptr = &ch;
    // To print the address of a char pointer, you need to cast it as void*
    std::cout << (void*) ch_ptr;

    return 0;
}
```

<br/><br/>



## Pointer Arithmetic
<br/>

In the video we went over a basic example of pointer arithmetic using a simple increment and decrement demonstration.

There are actually 5 different methods we can employ to perform arithmetic with pointers.
  1. Pointer Increment:   `p++;`
  2. Pointer Decrement:   `p--;`
  3. Constant Addition:   `p = p + k;`  where k is a constant value, 1,2,3,4 etc.
  4. Constant Subtraction:  `p = p - k;`
  5. Subtraction of one pointer from another:  `m = p - q;`

Also remember that the pointer takes on the base type of the variable address we are pointing to. In the case of an integer variable, the pointer will be of base type int which takes up 4 bytes of memory on most modern PCs.

So when we perform arithmetic on a pointer, the size in bytes of the base type is used, meaning when we increment a int pointer (p++) the increment will move the pointer forward 4 bytes in memory. If we add 4 to a pointer (p=p+4) we will move the pointer 4 base units or 16 bytes forward in memory.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<br/><br/>

Referencing the image above, we can demonstrate these arithmetic operations, assume the image is an array named arr.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
int arr[10] = {4,11,18,18,23,30,54,66,80,92};
int* p = &arr[0];
int* q = &arr[8];
std::cout << "Initial values of pointer p:\t\taddress: " << p << ", value: " << * p << std::endl;
std::cout << "Initial values of pointer q:\t\taddress: " << q << ", value: " << * q << std::endl;
p++;
std::cout << "\nValue after incrementing p by one:\taddress: " << p << ", value: " << * p << std::endl;
p=p+5;
std::cout << "\nValue after adding 5 to p:\t\taddress: " << p << ", value: " << * p << std::endl;
p--;
std::cout << "\nValue after decrementing p by one:\taddress: " << p << ", value: " << * p << std::endl;
p=p-2;
std::cout << "\nValue after subtracting 2 from p:\taddress: " << p << ", value: " << * p << std::endl;
std::cout << "\nResult of subtracting p from q:\t\t" << q-p << std::endl;

return 0;
}
```
Output:<br/>
Initial values of pointer p:            address: 0x6dfec0, value: 4 <br/>
Initial values of pointer q:            address: 0x6dfee0, value: 80 <br/><br/>
Value after incrementing p by one:      address: 0x6dfec4, value: 11 <br/><br/>
Value after adding 5 to p:              address: 0x6dfed8, value: 54 <br/><br/>
Value after decrementing p by one:      address: 0x6dfed4, value: 30 <br/><br/>
Value after subtracting 2 from p:       address: 0x6dfecc, value: 18 <br/><br/>
Result of subtracting p from q:         5 <br/><br/>

Note that the last arithmetic operation subtracting p from q returns the number of integer (4 byte) units between the two pointers, in this case 5 units.
