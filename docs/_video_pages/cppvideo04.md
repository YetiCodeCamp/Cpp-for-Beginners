This is a short video that quickly goes over how we can execute our programs outside of the CodeBlocks IDE.

Up until now we have been running our programs inside the CodeBlcoks IDE, which is fine for quick examples and testing. However, it is a good idea to check the programs functionality on its own. The first time you run one of these example programs on its own, you may be surprised to find it open and closes right away before you can even see any output on the console.

Normally this is because there is no code to hold the window open. When executing within the CodeBlocks (or even Visual Studio) IDE, the IDE will hold the console open until you close it.

It is also a good idea to test run the release version of any program you plan to distribute in this manner in order to test the performance.
