title: 1.2 Comments

A comment in C++ is a way to "hide" the text from the compiler so that it is ignored during program compilation.

There are two styles of comments, single-line and block comments.

### Single-line comments
By placing two forward slashes // in front of the text you wish to make a comment, instructs the compiler to ignore everything starting with from the // to the end of the line.

Single-line comment example:

```cpp
// The line is a comment and is ignored by the compiler.
```
We can also comment out only part of a line. In the next example the first part is valid C++ code the compiler will act upon, but once it encounters // it will ignore the rest of the line.

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl; // Everything from this point to the end of the line is a comment and ignored by the compiler.
```
Here is another example with multiple lines of code using single-line comments:
```cpp
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)   // for loop, iterates from 0 to 9
{
  std::cout << "Interrater 'i' is currently: " << i << std::endl;    // Prints the current value of 'i' to the console
}
```

Comments can also be used above the line they are making a comment about:
```cpp
// This statement is really long and needs a comment above it
std::cout << "I am a really long string of text to help demonstrate that you should place a comment above me as I am too long to fit a comment on the same line." << std::endl;
```

If you have many single-line comments used at the end of lines, you can use tabs to align them to make it easier to read.
```cpp
int a,b,c,d,e;                   //Create 5 variables of type int
float f1,f2,f3;                  // Create 3 variables of type float
a=10, b=20, c=30, d=40, e=50;    // Set int values
f1=2.34, f2=1.2, f3=7.85;        // Set float values
```

Comments are also useful to prevent a line of code from compiling and executing. This is useful if you are troubleshooting and just want to temporarily disable a line of code without removing it entirely.
```cpp
int main()
{
    // std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "I am alive!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In the above example, only the line that outputs `I am alive!` will compile and be printed to the console.  
&nbsp;

Here is another example, only the line c = a * b; will be compiled and executed.
```cpp
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 2, c;

    // c = a + b;
    // c = a - b;
    c = a * b;
    // c = a / b;

    std::cout << "The result is: " << c << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
The output is: `The result is: 10`


### Block comments (multi-line)
We can also block out multiple lines of code by using a block (or multi-line) comment.
You start a block comment with /* and end it with */.
```cpp
/*
    I am an example of a block comment.
    I can span multiple lines to help convey a more complete description of complicated code or logic.
    ...
    Use block comments when you have a large amount of text you want to be hidden from the compiler.
*/
```
