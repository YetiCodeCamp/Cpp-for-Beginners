# How a C++ program is actually build
&nbsp;  

If you haven't already, I highly suggest you start with the [Working with the GCC Compiler lesson](gcc) before moving on to this lesson. Also, some basic familiarity with [Using Vim](vim) will prove useful.

In most of our programs thus far, we have been doing everything within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and I have often used the statements building and running a program interchangeably with compiling it. Thus, it is easy to think of these meaning the same thing, but in reality they are actually quite different processes.

While compiling is a major component of actually building our C++ files, there is a little more going on behind the scenes than just that one aspect. Building a program encompasses not only compiling, but also other related functions including preprocessing, assembling, and linking.

&nbsp;  

## The build process

The actual build process of turning our raw code contained in the source file(s) into an actual executable program can be broken into four major steps:

1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation
3. Assembling
4. Linking
&nbsp;

Shown above is a general overview of a simple hello.c program.

If you followed the last tutorial you should have a simple hello.c file.

If not here are the required steps again for review:

Type:
```plaintext
C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects>mkdir hello
C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects>cd hello
C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects\hello>vim hello.c
```
&nbsp;  

You should now be in the Vim editor. Press the insert mode key "**i**" and type the following:
```vim
// Simple Hello World program
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{    
    printf("Hello World, remember me?\n");
    return 0;
}
```
After creating the program as shown above, type :wq to write the file and quit Vim.

We will now compile and build it. We will quickly compile it normally just to make sure there are no errors in our code.
```plaintext
 C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects\example> gcc -Wextra hello.c -o hello
```
If there are no compile errors, (resolve them first if there are) we will compile it again with the extra flag of: –save-temps
```plaintext
 C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects\example> gcc -Wextra –save-temps hello.c -o hello
```
This will save all the intermediate build files in the current directory along with the executable.

Your directory should now look like this:
```plaintext
C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects\hello>dir

 Directory of C:\Users\Scott\gcc_projects\hello

12/30/2019  11:45 PM    <DIR>          .
12/30/2019  11:45 PM    <DIR>          ..
12/30/2019  11:27 PM               131 hello.c
12/30/2019  11:28 PM            27,930 hello.exe
12/30/2019  11:28 PM            18,480 hello.i
12/30/2019  11:28 PM               656 hello.o
12/30/2019  11:28 PM               432 hello.s
```

Overview of the C++ build process of our example hello.c program.

### Preprocessing

We have actually been working with what are known as preprocessor directives ever since our first Hello World program.

At the top of every file there was an #include file that started with the prefix '#', as shown here:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
&nbsp;  

This statement is called a preprocessor directive. A program known as the preprocessor looks for these statements in order to manipulate the text of the source code file before it is sent on to be compiled.

In the case of the include directive, the preprocessor "includes" the contents of the specified file as though it were actually written at the point where the directive appears. You can think of it as a kind of copy/pasting of the include file's code into your source file at the location of the include statement.

It is also worth pointing out that  the preprocessing directive #include has two variations.

\#include <header> is used for system header files and will look for the file in common system directories.

\#include "header" is used for local header files, from your own programs or others that are not part of standard libraries or contained within a system directory.

There are several preprocessor directives other than include, just a few of which are shown here:

```cpp
#define
#pragma
#import
#ifndef
#endif
```
&nbsp;  

While pre-processor directives can appear anywhere within a source file, keep in mind that they only take effect from the point of their appearance onward. This is why you will typically see them at the top of our source files, as we want their functionality to be available to all of our code. As mentioned earlier, think of it as copying the include files source code into your program at the point of the include statement.

In addition to preprocessor directives, the preprocessor can utilize preprocessor operators, predefined macros, and if using a Microsoft compiler, Pragmas.

A discussion of the different preprocessor functionality is include toward the end of this guide, but for now it is enough to know of their existence.

Preprocessors also clean up the code by removing comments (replacing them with a single space) and merging continuing lines into one long line by removing the \ and joining the lines. and performs a conditional compilation.

Once the preprocessor finishes all of its tasks, it outputs an intermediate file, in our case hello.i.

If you open up the hello.i file we made above in Vim you can see its contents.

![Contents of hello.i file](images\gcc_compiler\hello-i.jpg)

As you can see, there is a lot of added information, mostly from the stdio.h file we included. In Vim, by pressing G in normal mode you can go to the end of the file, where our code remains basically intact. All of the code above these 5 lines is basically the expanded header files from either stdio.h itself, or code it referenced from other header files.

So now our simple 5 line program is around 440 lines of code. Remembering back to our earliest lessons, you recall me saying this include file is what allows our program to run, and as you now can appreciate, there is a lot of behind the scenes work already done for us.

### Compilation

The hello.i file from the preprocessor is now input into the compiler. The compiler then distills down all the code into what it actually needs to make our program work. Since a lot of functionally is to be provided by external libraries, such as the printf() function, to compiler only needs to provide a stub for the assembler and linker to associate and include the required code we need later.

The compiler translates the preprocessor's hello.i source code output to machine-specific assembly code (an .s file).

Use the -S option for gcc to produce a .s file:
```plaintext
$ gcc -S hello.c
```
