# C++ for Beginners Video Series  
<br/><br/>

Welcome to the companion website to the **C++ for Beginners** video series on YouTube.

This site will contain material to supplement the videos and help you learn to program in C++.  

<br/><br/>

For an overview of the CodeBlocks installation process and a few other setup tips/tricks, refer to:  

[Initial Setup of Code Blocks IDE](codeblocks)

[A Word on Comments](comments)

[Compile Programs from the Windows Command Line](gcc)

[Using the Vim Text Editor](vim)

<br/><br/>



## Video Playlist  

<br/><br/>

I am currently working on developing a separate page for each video, currently I have [Video 09 - Arrays](cppvideo09) and [Video10 - Multidimensional Arrays and Introduction to Vectors](cppvideo10) content on their own pages.

The rest of the series is listed below for now.

<br/><br/>

### Lesson 1 - Hello World

&nbsp;


The first video covers downloading, installing, and using the Code::Blocks IDE.

We then go over the simple Hello World program automatically generated by the IDE, as shown below:

&nbsp;


```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
<br/><br/>




### Lesson 2 - Improved Hello World

### Lesson 3 - Variables and Functions

```cpp
Logical Operators:  && AND,  || OR,  ! NOT

Assignment Operators: "=" assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.  Ex:  int a = 10;

There are also +=. -=, *=, /=, and %= assignment operators.

int a = 5;
a += 5;   // a is now equal to 10, this operator adds 5  to a's original value then assigns the new sum back to 'a'.

int b = 10;

b -= 5;   // b is now equal to 5, this operator subtracts 5  from b's original value then assigns the result back to 'b'.

int c = 5;
c *= 5;   // c is now equal to 25, this operator multiplies 5  to c's original value then assigns the result back to 'c'.

Functions:
Declaration: the functions name, return type, and parameters (if any). Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed).

Functions are declared in the format:

return-type functionName(parameters)  

Function Declaration Example:

int myFunction(param1, param 2)
 - returns an int, name is myFunction, and accepts two parameters.

Variable Declaration:   int a;

Creates a variable named 'a' that is of type int (integer).

Variable Initialization:   a = 22;

 Previously declared variable 'a' is assigned the value of '22'.

Variable Declaration and Initialization:  float pi = 3.14159;

Creates a new variable of the float type named pi and is assigned the value 3.14159


The 'if' statement is used to execute a block of C++ code if a condition evaluates to true.

```
